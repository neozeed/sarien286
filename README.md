This is shamelessly forked from https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/sarien-j2me

I mashed it into something that'll run on pharlap 286's dos extender.

It runs on my IBM PS/2 model 60, so that's nice.  I modified it to load/save games in the same directory.

I tested it on Space Quest 2.0f  should work on the steam/cd-rom collections. I think.

For some reason the VGA driver doesn't work, but the CGA one does.

If you want to run this on 80286/8086 use the real mode version (makereal)

I used Microsoft C 6.0a, and pharlap 286 2.5
